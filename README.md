## Billy Hoy — PhD Student & Navy Researcher

I am a PhD student in **Operations Research & Systems Engineering** at the University of Miami, with an undergraduate background in **Mechanical Engineering**. I also work at the **Center for Naval Analyses (CNA)**, the Navy’s federally funded research and development center, where I contribute to data driven research and operational analysis for defense applications.

## Past Work and Publications

### **STABLE: Gated Continual Learning for Large Language Models** *(First Author)*  
Proposed a gated continual learning method for LLMs that applies LoRA based updates only when they meet stability criteria, reducing catastrophic forgetting while enabling efficient sequential adaptation.  
 **Paper:** [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16089)

### **Medical Computer Vision Research** *(Second Author)*  
Developed YOLO based detection and segmentation models for surgical instrument tracking and designed temporal metrics for evaluating surgical skill.  
**Paper:** [ScienceDirect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0039606025003927?dgcid=coauthor)

### **FAA Data Challenge – Finalist Project and Conference Paper**  
Built reinforcement learning models to optimize routing and decision making for eVTOL operations under uncertainty.  
**Paper:** [ACM Digital Library](https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.5555/3712729.3712773)
